City Council is the decision-maker. Process seen as vetting, building consensus, so unlikely to revert [to a previous draft]. Too often, process becomes finding path of least resistance. Approving \"something\" instead of right thing.\r\n> >[Joe LaCava](https://twitter.com/joe_lacava)\r\n\r\nMore Information:\r\n* [But why bike lanes?](https://github.com/simpixelated/san-diego-downtown-mobility-plan/blob/master/references.md)\r\n* [Open Letter to Mayor Kevin Faulconer](https://github.com/simpixelated/san-diego-biking/blob/master/letters/mayor-faulconer.md)\r\n",
