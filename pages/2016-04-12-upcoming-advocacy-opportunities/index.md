>Planning Commission and Smart Growth and Land Use are advisory but set the tone. City Council is the decision-maker. Process seen as vetting, building consensus, so unlikely to revert [to a previous draft]. Too often, process becomes finding path of least resistance. Approving "something" instead of right thing.
