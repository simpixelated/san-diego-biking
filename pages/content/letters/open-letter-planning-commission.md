Dear Planning Commission Members:

As a resident of Little Italy along with my wife and daughter, I ask you to approve the Downtown Mobility Plan. There is a vocal opposition unhappy about the loss of parking, but I ask you to put the longterm health and safety of our citizens ahead of [cheap car storage on public streets](http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/10/the-take-parking-in-boston/). Approving the plan is a necessity for future generations, but it can help improve current local businesses by making downtown a world class destination for tourists and residents alike.

Parking in dense, urban areas is not as important as most business owners think. In fact, many [tend to overestimate](http://cidadanialxmob.tripod.com/shoppersandhowtheytravel.pdf) how many customers arrive by car [by as much as 32%](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2013/08/01/geary-brt-plan-watered-down-to-appease-parking-obsessed-merchants/). Many of their current customers arrive by foot, bike, and transit. The addition of bike lanes [attracts new riders](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/facilities-statistics#if-you-build-it-they-will-come) adding [new sources of revenue](https://slowstreets.wordpress.com/2016/02/05/a-better-business-case-for-bike-lanes/). Studies have shown that customers who arrive by bike [spend at least as much](http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2015/03/the-complete-business-case-for-converting-street-parking-into-bike-lanes/387595/) as those who arrive by car, [if not more](http://www.cleanairpartnership.org/files/BikeLanes_Parking_Business_BloorWestVillage.pdf).

The buffer created by the protected lanes will help calm traffic, creating a safer and more inviting sidewalk for pedestrians, leading to [spin-off revenue for nearby businesses](http://www.sfbike.org/download/actions/traffic_calming_summary.pdf). People flock to Little Italy for this exact reason, which is why the Little Italy Association is willing to close several blocks to vehicular traffic on a weekly basis for the farmer's market and soon permanently for [Piazza Famiglia](http://www.littleitalysd.com/explore/piazza-famiglia).

Bicycle friendly businesses are already benefiting from nearly cost-free marketing channels thanks to programs like [SD Bike Commuter Discount](http://sdbikecommuter.com/find_businesses/), SANDAG's own [iCommute](http://www.icommutesd.com/bike/bike-to-work), and events hosted by [BikeSD](http://bikesd.org/), [SDCBC](http://sdbikecoalition.org/), and others. Every business within a block of the new cycle tracks will be able to maximize this cheap promotion. San Diego is already receiving [national attention](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/san-diego-downtown-mobility-plan-bike-safety) for the proposed plan and tourism will [inevitably increase with a safe bicycling network](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/economic-statistics#economic-benefits-of-the-bicycling-industry-and-tourism).

Protected bike lanes have been proven time and again to not only avoid negatively impacting businesses, but to be a net positive for the whole city. They will [raise property values](http://www.uc.edu/news/NR.aspx?id=14300), attract [hi-tech companies](http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/amazon-gives-a-push-to-biking-downtown/) and their [millennial employees](http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/apr/22/michell-walshok-innovation-economy-04232016/), improve [health](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/economic-statistics#cost-of-inactivity-overweight-and-obesity) and [safety](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/safety-statistics), and help the city achieve it's [Climate Action Plan](https://www.sandiego.gov/planning/genplan/cap/) goals.

Please help shape the right future for San Diego and vote for the Downtown Mobility Plan.

Sincerely,

Concerned Resident,

Jordan Kohl
