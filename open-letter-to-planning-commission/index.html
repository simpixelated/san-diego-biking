<p>As a resident of Little Italy along with my wife and daughter, I ask you to approve the <a href="http://www.downtownsdmobility.com/app_pages/view/10">Downtown Mobility Plan</a>. There is a vocal opposition unhappy about the loss of parking, but I ask you to put the longterm health and safety of our citizens ahead of cheap car storage on public streets<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. Approving the plan is a necessity for future generations, but it can help improve current local businesses by making downtown a world class destination for tourists and residents alike.</p>
<p>Parking in dense, urban areas is not as important as most business owners think. In fact, many tend to overestimate<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> how many customers arrive by car by as much as 32%<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>. Many of their current customers arrive by foot, bike, and transit. The addition of bike lanes <a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/facilities-statistics#if-you-build-it-they-will-come">attracts new riders</a>, adding new sources of revenue<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. Studies have shown that customers who arrive by bike spend at least as much<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup> as those who arrive by car, if not more<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The buffer created by the protected lanes will help calm traffic, creating a safer and more inviting sidewalk for pedestrians, leading to spin-off revenue for nearby businesses<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>. People flock to Little Italy for this exact reason, which is why the Little Italy Association is willing to close several blocks to vehicular traffic on a weekly basis for the farmer’s market and soon permanently for <a href="http://www.littleitalysd.com/explore/piazza-famiglia">Piazza Famiglia</a>.</p>
<p>Bicycle friendly businesses are already benefiting from nearly cost-free marketing channels thanks to programs like <a href="http://sdbikecommuter.com/find_businesses/">SD Bike Commuter Discount</a>, SANDAG’s own <a href="http://www.icommutesd.com/bike/bike-to-work">iCommute</a>, and events hosted by <a href="http://bikesd.org/">BikeSD</a>, <a href="http://sdbikecoalition.org/">SDCBC</a>, and others. Every business within a block of the new cycle tracks will be able to maximize this cheap promotion. San Diego is already receiving <a href="https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/san-diego-downtown-mobility-plan-bike-safety">national attention</a> for the proposed plan and tourism will <a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/economic-statistics#economic-benefits-of-the-bicycling-industry-and-tourism">inevitably increase with a safe bicycling network</a>.</p>
<p>Protected bike lanes have been proven time and again to not only avoid negatively impacting businesses, but to be a net positive for the whole city. They will raise property values<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>, attract <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/amazon-gives-a-push-to-biking-downtown/">hi-tech companies</a> and their millennial employees<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>, improve <a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/economic-statistics#cost-of-inactivity-overweight-and-obesity">health</a> and <a href="http://www.peopleforbikes.org/statistics/category/safety-statistics">safety</a>, and help the city achieve it’s <a href="https://www.sandiego.gov/planning/genplan/cap/">Climate Action Plan</a> and <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/feb/25/traffic-deaths-injuries/">Vision Zero</a> goals.</p>
<p>Please help shape the right future for San Diego and vote for the Downtown Mobility Plan.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Concerned Resident,</p>
<p>Jordan Kohl</p>

<li id="fn1"  class="footnote-item"><p>The $10-an-hour difference between a garage and a metered spot in Boston gives “drivers a license to hunt,” says Mark Chase, a local parking consultant,“but it’s not a guarantee of a parking place.” The result, naturally, is congestion. Studies from around the country have shown that as much as 34 percent of all traffic in downtown areas involves drivers just looking for parking spaces. Meanwhile, Boston has set aside a ton of spaces for resident-only parking in neighborhoods, and it charges nothing for the permits to use them. And what happens when it doesn’t cost anything to keep cars parked on the street? They stay there. Today more than 311,000 vehicles are registered in Boston, and more than 87,000 of them have residential parking permits. Each of those cars takes up around 160 square feet—the size of a street spot—of prime city real estate.“You have some of the most valuable land on earth, and you’re giving it away for free to cars,” says Donald Shoup, a professor of urban planning at UCLA, and the author of The High Cost of Free Parking. “It’s preposterous.” - <em><a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/2012/10/the-take-parking-in-boston/">“Why Parking in Boston Should Be More Expensive”, Boston Magazine</a></em> <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn2"  class="footnote-item"><p>In a study of merchants and shoppers in Bristol, UK, researchers found that merchants guessed that 41% of their customers had arrived by car, when in fact only 22% had done so. Merchants also over-estimated how far away their customers lived, and disagreed with their customers about the impact of transit improvements. A study of Graz, Austria, found similar misconceptions among merchants. - <em><a href="http://cidadanialxmob.tripod.com/shoppersandhowtheytravel.pdf">Shoppers and how they travel, 2006</a></em> <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

Additionally, shoppers who arrived without cars visited businesses more frequently than those who arrived by car. - <em><a href="http://sf.streetsblog.org/2013/08/01/geary-brt-plan-watered-down-to-appease-parking-obsessed-merchants/">“Geary BRT Plan Watered Down to Appease Parking-Obsessed Merchants”, streetsblog.org</a></em> <a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>

their business and/or sales, and the same percentage would support more traffic calming on Valencia
Street. Thirty-seven percent of merchants reported that the bike lanes have increased their sales. Seventy-three
percent thought that the bike lanes have made the street more attractive. Surprising percentages of merchants
reported that increased congestion (41%) and reduced auto speed (46%) were good conditions for business. On
eleven of the nineteen variables, not one merchant reported that the bike lanes had made conditions “worse” - <em><a href="http://www.sfbike.org/download/actions/traffic_calming_summary.pdf">Economic Effects of Traffic Calming on Urban Small Businesses, 2003</a></em> <a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></p>
